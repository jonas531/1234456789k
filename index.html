                 Joining a young docent program for Zheng's Family Mansion was a great opportunity for me as I am quite interested in Macau history and East- West mix culture. The mansion is a well-known historical site in Macau and is one of the few remaining  combination of Chinese and Western elements  style mansions in this region.</p>

<p class="article__content">
    As a docent for the mansion, I have the opportunity to share the history and cultural significance of the site with visitors from around the world. This was a great way to develop my public speaking skills and gain experience in communicating with people from different cultures and backgrounds.

                On my latest excursion, I went the Ruins of St. Paul to delve into the history of this iconic landmark and its surrounding structures.

<p class="article__content">Following my initial guided tour of Zheng's Family Mansion, I had already gained a plethora of skills in tourism. However, the Ruins of St. Paul presented an even greater challenge, as I had to field numerous questions from visitors all at once. Fortunately, I was able to rise to the occasion and became one of the program's most outstanding students.</p>

                Attending this workshop was the most interesting experience I have ever had. Although waking up at 4:00 am to travel to Hong Kong was tiring, it was meaningful to gain so many skills in English. Specifically, I gained presentation skills, communication skills, and writing skills that will undoubtedly help me in the upcoming writing competition in April. The winner of the competition will have the opportunity to go to Temple University in Philadelphia from July 7 to 29, and I am confident that the skills I gained from this workshop will give me an advantage in the competition.

                Of all the achievements that I have accomplished, the most impressive one must be the Twelfth Macao Geography Olympiad. This event changed my thinking in several ways, as I learned a lot from it.</p>

                <p class="article__content">
During my preparation for the competition, I dedicated a lot of time to it. Since we received the invitation to join the match in February, we only had less than two months to prepare for it. To increase our chances of winning, we needed to have classes twice a week after school. However, I felt that this was not enough to win, so I studied geography at home every day of the week. I even asked my friends to test me on various topics to ensure that I had a deep understanding of the concepts. When I found out that I had won the silver prize in the competition, I was relieved. Finally, all my hard work paid off after days of intense preparation. I had achieved the greatest result in the team, which was also my first time participating in the competition.</p>
 
        <p class="article__content">
Moreover, it felt like the first time I worked hard to achieve something. My teacher always said that I was the hope of the team. At first, I did not understand what that meant, but now I realize that she was trying to emphasize that I was willing to put more effort into something I enjoyed than others in the team. I felt a sense of excitement and motivation to discover new things that I have never felt before.          </p>
        
        <p class="article__content">
In conclusion, the Twelfth Macao Geography Olympiad was a turning point in my life that changed my aims in the future. Although I used to love money and wanted to become an economist, I now yearn for a free life traveling all around the world rather than being trapped in the concrete jungle. I realized that life is short, and there are so many adventures waiting for me out there.

            <p class="article__content">
                Attending the workshop on April 6th was incredibly helpful, as I was able to apply the skills I learned in class to write my essay. I was determined to win the competition and spent over six hours working on my essay, carefully considering every single word. My hard work paid off, and I was one of only ten people selected for the competition. As a result, I was awarded a scholarship to attend a pre-college program in Temple University's Center for American Language and Culture in Philadelphia for three weeks, free of charge. It is a great honor to be selected for this program, and I am truly grateful to those who helped me during the workshop and to those who selected and sponsored me for this opportunity.
